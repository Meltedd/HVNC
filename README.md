# HVNC - Tinynuke (Fixed)
This HVNC (Hidden Virtual Network Computing) Client and Server is based off of Tinynuke's HVNC (C++).

I do **NOT** encourage malicious use of this code. This was made for educational purposes only.

# Features:
- Start Explorer (Hidden Desktop)
- Open "Run"
- Start Powershell
- Start Chrome
- Start Edge
- Start Brave
- Start Firefox
- Start Internet Explorer

# Usage:
- In the Client's "Main.cpp" file, edit the ip and port variables.
- Compile the Server & Client, and run the Server. 
- Enter the port to listen on in the Server's console when prompted.
- When the Client is executed, it will open a new "Hidden Desktop" window. If you right-click on the white bar at the top of the "Hidden Desktop" window, you can view the available commands that you can run on the target machine.
